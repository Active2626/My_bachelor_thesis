--------------------------- Features -----------------------------------

Connection features:
    1. Number of flows
    2. Total size of all flows
    3. Number of ssl logs
    4. Total size of ssl logs
    5. Number of ssl handshakes in one connection
    6. List of offered ciphersuites
    7. List of advertised extension


Conn.log file intersting feature:
1. service: An identification of an application protocol being sent over the connection
2. conn_state: S0, S1, ...
3. local_orig: If the connection is originated locally, this value will be T.
    If it was originated remotely it will be F. In the case that the Site::local_nets variable is undefined,
    this field will be left empty at all times.
4. local_resp: If the connection is responded to locally, this value will be T.
    If it was responded to remotely it will be F. In the case that the Site::local_nets variable is undefined,
    this field will be left empty at all times.
5. missed_bytes
6. history of connection states


SSL.log file intersting features:
1. version: SSL/TLS version that the server choose.
2. cipher: SSL/TLS cipher suite that the server choose.
3. curve: Elliptic curve the server chose when using ECDH/ECDHE. (it is almost nowhere!!)
4. server_name: Value of the Server Name Indicator SSL/TLS extension. It indicates the server name that the client was requesting.
5. resumed: Flag to indicate if the session was resumed reusing the key material exchanged in an earlier connection.
6. established: Flag to indicate if this ssl session has been established successfully, or if it was aborted during the handshake.
7. cert_chain_fuids: An ordered vector of all certificate file unique IDs for the certificates offered by the server.
8. client_cert_chain_fuids: An ordered vector of all certificate file unique IDs for the certificates offered by the client.
9. subject: Subject of the X.509 certificate offered by the server.
10. issuer: Subject of the signer of the X.509 certificate offered by the server.

X.509. log is about certificate:

Flow features:
ok    1. Duration of a flow
    2. Size of a flow

ok   10-4. Validity of the certificate during capture/analysis. (True or False)
   10-5 Distance between the capture date and valid from date.
   10-6 Distance between the capture date and valid to date.
ok   10-7 Some relationship between the distance from capture date to valid from date???? differentiate the microsoft case from malware
   11. The flow has port 443 but there is no such ssl log


    Connection features:
ok  ok |1. a]
           b] Number of flows
ok  ok |2. a]
           b] Total payload size of flows
ok  ok |3.a  number of not ssl flows in connections, because you first go thru ssl log !!! -
        3.b  number of ssl flows in connection,
        3.c  ratio = (3.a / 3.b)
    x   3.d (Number of ssl handshakes in one connection??? - probably it is same as number of ssl log in connection
ok  ok  4. [histogram] List of offered ciphersuites (SSL/TLS cipher suite that the server chose.)
?    ?   5. List of advertised extension
ok  ok |6.  [histogram] Histogram of the state of connections (S_, SA_)
ok  ok |7.  [histogram] Size of public keys
ok  ok |8.  [histogram] Versions of ssl (SSL/TLS version that the server chose.)
ok  ok !.   [number] Amount of different certificates in the conn.
        . Does the certificate change because of validity date? or other things?
ok  ?    9. One certificate for more domains (The average number of domains per certificate in the connection)
ok  ?   10. A flow has port 443(and 963...) but there is no such ssl log

Evolution of project:
ok ! 1. To have prepared data for extracting features.
            a. checking if data are ok (labels are same, ...)
            b. label bro file from binetflow file.
none ! 2. Extract and evaluate features and select just best ones.
none ! 3. Select some machine learning algorithm.
none ! 4. Write results and thesis.
