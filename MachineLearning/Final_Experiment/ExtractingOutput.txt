<<< Welcome to Features evaluating project !!!
<<< You run Main_multi.py which extracts data from multi dataset.
<<< For more info see README.md or https://github.com/frenky-strasak/My_bachelor_thesis

<<<-------------------------------------------------------------------
<<< Program will start evaluate your multi dataset folder:
<<< ' c:\Users\frenk\Documents\Skola\Bachelor_thesis\Dataset\ '
<<< Number of single data sets in multi folder:  85
<<< It will crete these data files:
